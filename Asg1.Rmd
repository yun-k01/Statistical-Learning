```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
test_Q1 <- read_csv("Desktop/STAT/STAT 457/test_Q1A1.csv")

### Q1. For each hâˆˆ{0.01,0.03,0.05,0.07,0.09,0.11} report the training and testing mean square error. Discuss the trend of training error as h increases, and also report the value of h that has the smallest testing error.
``` {r}
# creating a vector for h
h = c(0.01,0.03,0.05,0.07,0.09,0.11)

```

```{r}
# writing the function of f_hat
f_hat = function(x, y, test_x, h) {
  n = length(x)
  m = length(test_x)
  
  pred_res = rep(0, m)
  
  for (j in 1:m) {
    tilda_x = test_x[j]
    
    temp_denom = 0
    temp_num = 0
    
    for (i in 1:n) {
      temp_num = temp_num + y[i]*I(tilda_x - abs(x[i]) <= h)
      temp_denom = temp_denom + I(tilda_x - abs(x[i]) <= h)
    }
    pred_res[j] = temp_num / temp_denom
  }
  return(pred_res)
}
```

```{r}
pred_res = f_hat(train_Q1$x, train_Q1$y, test_Q1$test_x, h)
```

```{r}
# writing a function determine the mean square testing error given the different h values
meanSqError = function(pred_res, test_y, x, test_x) {
  n = length(x)
  m = length(test_x)
  
  tilda_y = test_y
  
  train_error = 0
  test_error = 0
  
  for (l in 1:n) {
    train_error = train_error + (y[l] - pred_res[l])
  }
  
  for (j in 1:m) {
    test_error = test_error + (tilda_y[j] - pred_res[j])
  }
  
  train_mse = 1/n * train_error
  test_mse = 1/m * test_error
  mse_df = data.frame(train_mse, test_mse)
  
  return(mse_df)
}
```

``` {r}
mse = meanSqError(pred_res, test_Q1$test_y, train_Q1$x, test_Q1$test_x)
print(mse)
```

Thus, we find that the mean squared error is smaller in the __ subset.
